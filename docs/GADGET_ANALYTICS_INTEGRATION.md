## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API Key" Error**
   - Solution: Update the API key in both `gadget-analytics.js` and
     `server/services/gadget-analytics.ts`

2. **"No shops found" Error**
   - Solution: This means either the API key is wrong or there's no data in the
     checkout system yet

3. **"Failed to fetch" Error**
   - Solution: Check if the Gadget app is running and accessible

4. **Dashboard shows zero values**
   - Solution: This is normal if there's no data yet. The dashboard will show
     real data once businesses start using your tracking system

### Testing the API Key

You can test if your API key works by running this in your browser console:

```javascript
fetch("https://checkoutdata--development.gadget.app/api/graphql", {
   method: "POST",
   headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
      query:
         `query { shopifyShops(first: 5) { edges { node { id domain name } } } }`,
   }),
})
   .then((response) => response.json())
   .then((data) => console.log(data));
```
