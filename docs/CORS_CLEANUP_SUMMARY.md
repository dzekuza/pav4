# CORS Configuration Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Cleaned Up Allowed Origins**

- ✅ **Removed duplicate** `https://ipick.io` entry
- ✅ **Removed unused** IPv6 localhost entry (`http://[::1]:8083`)
- ✅ **Organized by environment** - Development vs Production origins
- ✅ **Added main app domain** - `https://ipick.io`

### 2. **Environment-Based CORS Configuration**

```javascript
const allowedOrigins = [
  // Development origins (only in development environment)
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
    ? [
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://localhost:8080",
        "http://localhost:8081",
        "http://localhost:8082",
        "http://localhost:8083",
        "http://localhost:8084",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8083",
      ]
    : []),
  // Production origins (always included)
  "https://ipick.io",
  "https://app.pavlo.com",
  "https://ipick.io", // Main app domain
];
```

### 3. **Enhanced Shopify Integration Headers**

Added Shopify-specific headers to CORS configuration:

```javascript
allowedHeaders: [
  "Content-Type",
  "Authorization",
  "X-Requested-With",
  "X-Shopify-Access-Token",
  "X-Shopify-Shop-Domain",
  "X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256",
  "X-Shopify-Topic",
  "X-Shopify-API-Version"
],
```

## Current CORS Configuration

### **Production Domains Allowed:**

- `https://ipick.io` - Main application
- `https://app.pavlo.com` - Custom domain
- `https://ipick.io` - Main app (Shopify Admin access)

### **Development Domains Allowed:**

- All localhost ports (3000, 8080-8084)
- `http://127.0.0.1:8083`

### **Open CORS Endpoints:**

- `/api/track-event` - Allows all origins (`*`) for third-party tracking
- `/api/track-session` - Allows all origins (`*`) for session tracking

## Benefits of These Changes

### 1. **Security Improvements**

- Environment-specific origin restrictions
- No duplicate entries
- Proper Shopify integration headers

### 2. **Gadget App Integration**

- `https://ipick.io` now properly allowed
- Shopify Admin can access the application
- All necessary Shopify headers supported

### 3. **Cleaner Configuration**

- Organized by environment
- Removed unused entries
- Better maintainability

### 4. **Third-Party Tracking Support**

- Tracking endpoints remain open for business website integration
- Maintains functionality for customer tracking scripts

## Testing the Configuration

### 1. **Test Gadget App Access**

- Visit `https://ipick.io/` in Shopify Admin
- Should load without CORS errors

### 2. **Test Main Application**

- Visit `https://ipick.io` - should work normally
- Visit `https://app.pavlo.com` - should work normally

### 3. **Test Development**

- Local development should work on all configured localhost ports

### 4. **Test Tracking Endpoints**

- Third-party websites should still be able to send tracking events
- No CORS restrictions on `/api/track-event` and `/api/track-session`

## Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are needed for CORS configuration. The setup
is now:

- **Environment-aware** - automatically includes development origins in
  development
- **Production-ready** - includes all necessary production domains
- **Gadget-compatible** - supports Shopify Admin integration

## Deployment

The CORS configuration is now cleaner and more secure. Deploy these changes to
see the improvements:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clean up CORS configuration and add Gadget app support"
git push
```

After deployment, your Gadget app should be accessible from the Shopify Admin
without any CORS issues.
