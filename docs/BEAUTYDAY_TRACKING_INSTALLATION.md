   - `‚úÖ iPick: add_to_cart event sent successfully`

### Method 2: Local Test Environment

2. Open it in a browser
3. Use the test controls to simulate events
4. Check the console output for tracking messages

### Method 3: API Testing

Use the provided test scripts:

```bash
# Test the tracking endpoint
node scripts/test-beautyday-tracking.js

# Test with curl
./scripts/test-tracking-curl.sh

# Check recent tracking events
node scripts/check-tracking-events.js
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Database Events

```

Expected output:

```
üìä Found X recent tracking events:
1. Event ID: XX
   Type: page_view
   Session: session_XXXXXXXX
   URL: https://beautyday.lt/products/...
   Time: [timestamp]
   Data: {...}
```

### 2. Check Business Statistics

```
üìà Business Statistics:
   Name: Beautyday
   Total Visits: [number]
   Total Purchases: [number]
   Total Revenue: ‚Ç¨[amount]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Script Not Loading**
   - Check if the script URL is accessible: `https://ipick.io/ipick-tracking.js`
   - Verify the script tag is in the `<head>` section
   - Check browser console for network errors

2. **Events Not Sending**
   - Verify the business ID is correct (should be `4`)
   - Check CORS settings (endpoint allows all origins)
   - Look for JavaScript errors in browser console

3. **Wrong Business ID**
   - The script uses business ID `4` for beautyday.lt
   - Do not use string IDs like `'beautydayl'`

### Debug Mode

The tracking script includes console logging:

- ‚úÖ Success messages for successful events
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning messages for failed requests
- ‚ùå Error messages for network issues

## Data Flow

1. **User visits product page** ‚Üí `page_view` event sent
2. **User adds to cart** ‚Üí `add_to_cart` event sent
3. **User clicks checkout** ‚Üí `checkout` event sent
4. **Order completed** ‚Üí `purchase_complete` event sent

## Event Data Structure

Each event includes:

- Event type and timestamp
- Business and affiliate IDs
- User session information
- Product details (title, price, currency)
- Cart information (when applicable)
- Page URL and referrer

## Security Considerations

- The tracking script only sends non-sensitive data
- No personal information is collected
- All requests use HTTPS
- CORS is properly configured for cross-origin requests

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the script is loading correctly
3. Test the API endpoint directly
4. Check the database for recorded events
