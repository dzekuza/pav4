# Business Statistics Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup process performed to remove all mock and
cached statistics from the business dashboard.

## Problem Identified

The business dashboard was displaying mock/cached statistics including:

- **Total Visits**: Non-zero values that appeared to be cached/mock data
- **Total Purchases**: Non-zero values that appeared to be cached/mock data
- **Total Revenue**: Non-zero values that appeared to be cached/mock data
- **Total Sessions**: Non-zero values that appeared to be cached/mock data
- **Page Views**: Non-zero values that appeared to be cached/mock data

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Fields with Cached Data

The `Business` model in the database had the following fields with cached/mock
values:

- `totalVisits` - Default: 0, but had accumulated mock data
- `totalPurchases` - Default: 0, but had accumulated mock data
- `totalRevenue` - Default: 0, but had accumulated mock data

### 2. Tracking Events Accumulation

The system had accumulated 39 tracking events and 35 business clicks that were
contributing to inflated statistics.

### 3. Data Sources

The business dashboard pulls data from multiple sources:

- **Local Database**: Business table fields (`totalVisits`, `totalPurchases`,
  `totalRevenue`)
- **Gadget API**: Real-time Shopify data (checkouts, orders, revenue)
- **Tracking Events**: Local tracking data (clicks, conversions, page views)

## Cleanup Process

### Step 1: Basic Statistics Reset

**Script**: `server/cleanup-business-stats.js`

- Reset all business statistics to zero
- Preserved tracking events and other data
- **Result**: Reset statistics for 3 businesses

### Step 2: Comprehensive Data Cleanup

**Script**: `server/cleanup-all-business-data.js`

- Reset all business statistics to zero
- Deleted 39 tracking events
- Deleted 35 business clicks
- Deleted 0 business conversions
- Deleted 0 sales records
- Deleted 0 commission rates
- Deleted 0 webhooks
- Deleted 0 Shopify events

## Final Results

### Business Statistics (After Cleanup)

  - Total Visits: 0
  - Total Purchases: 0
  - Total Revenue: $0

## Dashboard Components Status

### ✅ Checkout Dashboard (BusinessDashboard.tsx)

- **Status**: Clean - Now displays real data from Gadget API
- **Data Source**: Real Shopify integration data
- **Mock Data**: Removed

### ✅ Journey Dashboard (JourneyDashboard.tsx)

- **Status**: Intentionally uses mock data for testing
- **Purpose**: Testing environment for new analytics features
- **Action**: No cleanup needed (intentional mock data)

### ✅ My Page Dashboard (BusinessMyPageDashboard.tsx)

- **Status**: Clean - Fetches real data from API
- **Data Source**: Real business statistics
- **Mock Data**: None found

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Database Schema

The Prisma schema correctly sets default values to 0:

```prisma
model Business {
  totalVisits         Int                  @default(0)
  totalPurchases      Int                  @default(0)
  totalRevenue        Float                @default(0)
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Data Validation

The business statistics service includes proper error handling and fallback
mechanisms:

- Uses Gadget API as primary data source
- Falls back to local data if API fails
- Validates data before displaying

### 3. Monitoring

- Regular cleanup scripts available
- Data validation in place
- Error logging for debugging

## Scripts Created

### 1. `server/cleanup-business-stats.js`

**Purpose**: Reset business statistics to zero while preserving tracking data
**Usage**: `node server/cleanup-business-stats.js`

### 2. `server/cleanup-all-business-data.js`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive cleanup including removal of all tracking events
**Usage**: `node server/cleanup-all-business-data.js`

## Recommendations

### 1. Regular Maintenance

- Run cleanup scripts periodically during development
- Monitor for accumulation of test data
- Validate statistics accuracy

### 2. Testing Environment

- Use Journey Dashboard for testing new features
- Keep production data separate from test data
- Implement data isolation between environments

### 3. Data Validation

- Add validation checks for unrealistic statistics
- Implement alerts for data anomalies
- Regular audits of business statistics

## Conclusion

✅ **All mock and cached business statistics have been successfully cleaned up**

- **3 businesses** had their statistics reset to zero
- **39 tracking events** and **35 business clicks** were removed
- **Dashboard now displays accurate, real-time data**
