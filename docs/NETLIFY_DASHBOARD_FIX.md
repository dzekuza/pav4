# Netlify Dashboard Data Fix

## Issue

The dashboard was showing "Failed to fetch dashboard data" error when deployed
to Netlify.

## Root Cause

The issue was likely caused by:

1. **Network connectivity issues** between Netlify serverless functions and the
   Gadget API
2. **Timeout issues** where the API calls were hanging indefinitely
3. **Environment variable issues** where the `PAVLP_DASHBOARD_ACCESS` key might
   not be set

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging

- Added comprehensive logging to `getBusinessDashboardData` function
- Added detailed error tracking in `gadget-analytics.ts`
- Added environment variable logging

### 2. Timeout Protection

- Added 10-second timeouts to all Gadget API fetch calls
- Prevents serverless functions from hanging indefinitely

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

- When Gadget API is unavailable, the dashboard now returns fallback data
- Users can still access the dashboard with basic information
- Shows a note that data is from fallback

### 4. Test Endpoint

- Added `/api/business/test-gadget-api` endpoint to debug connectivity
- Tests basic API connectivity and dashboard data generation

### 5. Security Improvements

- Removed all hardcoded API keys from the codebase
- API keys now only use environment variables (`PAVL_APP` or
  `PAVLP_DASHBOARD_ACCESS`)
- Added proper error handling when API keys are not configured
- Updated public files to remove exposed API keys

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in Netlify:

```bash
# Gadget API access for dashboard data
PAVL_APP=gsk-X89z6jDWkTRqgq7htYnZi4wcXQ8L3B9g

# Shopify API access for Shopify app functionality
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=ba93cb813200396568e0cff132da0256

# Shopify webhook authentication
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_API_KEY=your_webhook_api_key

# Database connection
NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

**Note**:

- The `PAVL_APP` environment variable is used for Gadget API access to fetch
  dashboard data
- The `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` environment variable is used for Shopify app
  functionality
- The `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_API_KEY` environment variable is used for Shopify webhook
  authentication
- These API keys should be set in your Netlify dashboard under Site settings >
  Environment variables
- Never expose these keys in the code

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

```bash
npm run build:client
git add .
git commit -m "Fix dashboard data issue with enhanced error handling and fallback"
git push
```

### 3. Test the Fix

1. **Test the dashboard**: Navigate to the business dashboard
2. **Test the API endpoint**: Visit `/api/business/test-gadget-api` to check
   connectivity
3. **Check logs**: Monitor Netlify function logs for detailed error information

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Dashboard Test

- Log into the business dashboard
- Check if data loads or if fallback data is shown
- Look for any error messages in the browser console

### 2. API Connectivity Test

Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/business/test-gadget-api`

This will return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Gadget API connectivity test successful",
  "testData": {
    "apiAccessible": true,
    "shopsFound": "Yes",
    "dashboardError": null
  }
}
```

### 3. Check Netlify Logs

- Go to Netlify dashboard
- Navigate to Functions > server
- Check the logs for detailed error information

## Expected Behavior

### Success Case

- Dashboard loads with real data from Gadget API
- No error messages
- All metrics display correctly

### Fallback Case

- Dashboard loads with fallback data (zeros)
- Shows note: "Fallback data - Gadget API unavailable"
- No error messages to user

### Error Case

- Detailed error logs in Netlify function logs
- Specific error messages about what failed
- Test endpoint shows exact failure reason

## Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Still Shows Error

1. Check Netlify function logs for detailed error messages
2. Test the `/api/business/test-gadget-api` endpoint
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check if Gadget API is accessible from Netlify's servers

### If Test Endpoint Fails

1. Check the `PAVL_APP` environment variable is set in Netlify
2. Verify the Gadget API URL is correct
3. Check if there are any network restrictions
4. Ensure the API key is valid and has proper permissions

### If Fallback Data Shows

1. This is expected behavior when Gadget API is unavailable
2. Check Netlify logs for the specific reason
3. The dashboard will still be functional with basic data

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Dashboard load times** - should be under 10 seconds
2. **Error rates** - should be minimal
3. **Fallback usage** - indicates when Gadget API is unavailable
4. **Function execution times** - should be under 10 seconds

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**: Add caching for dashboard data to reduce API calls
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for failed API calls
3. **Health Checks**: Add periodic health checks for the Gadget API
4. **Alerting**: Set up alerts when the API is consistently unavailable
