# Tracking Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Removed all checkout and purchase tracking code from the application, keeping
only post-redirect event tracking (add to cart, browse, page views, etc.). This
cleanup was performed to use only the tracking code from the `@checkoutdata/`
package for checkout and purchase events.

## Files Modified

### Server

- `server/routes/track-event.ts` - Added event type validation to only allow
  post-redirect events
- `server/services/database.ts` - Removed checkout and purchase tracking
  calculations

  `SalesTrackingData` interface

### Public

- `public/tracker.js` - Simplified to only track post-redirect events
- `public/shopify-tracker.js` - Simplified to only track post-redirect events
- `public/test-tracking.html` - Updated to only test post-redirect events

## Allowed Event Types

The following event types are now allowed for tracking:

- `page_view` - Page view events
- `product_view` - Product view events
- `add_to_cart` - Add to cart events
- `browse` - Browse/category view events
- `search` - Search events
- `category_view` - Category view events
- `wishlist_add` - Wishlist add events
- `wishlist_remove` - Wishlist remove events

## Removed Event Types

- `checkout_start` - Checkout start events
- `checkout_complete` - Checkout completion events
- `purchase` - Purchase events
- `purchase_complete` - Purchase completion events
- `conversion` - Conversion events
- `cart_update` - Cart update events
- `link_click` - Link click events

## Business Impact

### What Still Works

- Post-redirect event tracking (page views, product views, add to cart, browse)
- Business analytics for post-redirect events
- Affiliate click tracking
- Business dashboard for post-redirect metrics

### What No Longer Works

- Checkout tracking
- Purchase tracking
- Sales conversion tracking
- Revenue tracking from checkout/purchase events

## Next Steps

1. **Use @checkoutdata/ package** for checkout and purchase tracking
2. **Update business documentation** to reflect new tracking capabilities
3. **Test post-redirect tracking** to ensure it works correctly
4. **Update any external integrations** that relied on the removed tracking
   endpoints

## Configuration

Businesses should now use the `@checkoutdata/` package for checkout and purchase
tracking, while the existing tracking system handles post-redirect events like:

- User browsing behavior
- Product page views
- Add to cart actions
- Search behavior
- Category navigation

This separation ensures that checkout and purchase data is handled by the
dedicated Shopify integration, while general user behavior tracking remains with
the main application.
