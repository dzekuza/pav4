# Beautyday.lt Tracking Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The iPick tracking script has been successfully implemented and tested for
beautyday.lt.

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Business ID Correction

- **Issue**: Script was using string `'beautydayl'` as business ID
- **Fix**: Updated to numeric ID `'4'` (actual database ID for beautyday.lt)
- **Impact**: Events now properly associated with the correct business

### 2. Event Payload Structure

- **Issue**: Payload structure didn't match API expectations
- **Fix**: Updated to use snake_case field names (`event_type`, `business_id`,
  etc.)
- **Impact**: Events are now properly processed by the tracking endpoint

### 3. Session Tracking

- **Added**: Session ID generation and tracking
- **Benefit**: Better user journey tracking and duplicate prevention
