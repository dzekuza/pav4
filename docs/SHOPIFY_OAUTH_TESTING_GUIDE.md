# Shopify OAuth Testing Guide

## **üîç Issue Identified: Shopify Login Required**

The error "Business authentication required" occurs because:

1. ‚úÖ You're logged into your backend application
2. ‚ùå You're not logged into the Shopify store (`checkoutipick.myshopify.com`)
3. ‚ùå Shopify OAuth requires you to be logged into the store first

## **üöÄ Solution: Two-Step OAuth Flow**

I've implemented a two-step OAuth flow that handles this issue:

### **Step 1: Check if Shopify Login Required**

- Backend checks if user needs to login to Shopify first
- Provides Shopify login URL if needed
- Guides user through the process

### **Step 2: Proceed with OAuth**

- Once logged into Shopify, proceed with OAuth
- Gadget handles the OAuth flow
- User gets redirected to success page

## **üìã Testing Steps**

### **1. Start Your Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### **2. Open Browser and Navigate**

- Go to: `http://localhost:8083`
- Log in as a business user
- Navigate to Shopify integration

### **3. Enter Shop URL**

- Enter: `checkoutipick.myshopify.com`
- Click "Connect"

### **4. Handle Shopify Login (if prompted)**

If you see a message about needing to login to Shopify:

1. Click "Open Shopify Login" button
2. This opens `https://checkoutipick.myshopify.com/admin` in a new tab
3. Log in to your Shopify store
4. Return to the original tab
5. Click "Retry Connection"

### **5. Complete OAuth Flow**

- You should be redirected to Shopify's authorization page
- Review the requested permissions
- Click "Install" or "Allow"
- You'll be redirected back to your dashboard with success message

## **‚úÖ Expected Flow**

### **Scenario 1: Already Logged into Shopify**

1. Enter shop URL: `checkoutipick.myshopify.com`
2. Click Connect
3. Redirected to Shopify OAuth
4. Authorize the app
5. Success!

### **Scenario 2: Not Logged into Shopify**

1. Enter shop URL: `checkoutipick.myshopify.com`
2. Click Connect
3. See message: "Please login to your Shopify store first"
4. Click "Open Shopify Login"
5. Login to Shopify store
6. Return and click "Retry Connection"
7. Redirected to Shopify OAuth
8. Authorize the app
9. Success!

## **üîß Troubleshooting**

### **Issue 1: "Business authentication required"**

**Cause**: Not logged into your backend application **Solution**: Log in as a
business user first

### **Issue 2: "Please login to your Shopify store first"**

**Cause**: Not logged into the Shopify store **Solution**: Click "Open Shopify
Login" and login to Shopify

### **Issue 3: OAuth authorization fails**

**Cause**: Shopify store doesn't exist or wrong permissions **Solution**: Verify
the shop URL and ensure you have admin access

### **Issue 4: Redirect loop**

**Cause**: Callback URL configuration issue **Solution**: Check Gadget app
configuration

## **üìä Test Results**

### **Current Status**

- ‚úÖ Server running on port 8083
- ‚úÖ OAuth endpoints properly protected
- ‚úÖ Two-step flow implemented
- ‚úÖ Frontend updated to handle Shopify login
- ‚úÖ Gadget app running locally
- ‚úÖ Callback route deployed

### **Next Steps**

1. **Test the flow manually** using the steps above
2. **Monitor server logs** for any errors
3. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
4. **Verify success** by checking business record updates

## **üéØ Success Indicators**

When the OAuth flow works correctly, you should see:

- ‚úÖ Shopify authorization page asking for permissions
- ‚úÖ Success message: "Successfully connected to checkoutipick.myshopify.com"
- ‚úÖ Business record shows `shopifyStatus: "connected"`
- ‚úÖ Business record shows `shopifyShop: "checkoutipick.myshopify.com"`

## **üö® Emergency Fixes**

### **If OAuth completely fails:**

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Restart development server
3. Try with a different Shopify store
4. Check Gadget app logs

### **If Shopify login doesn't work:**

1. Verify the shop URL is correct
2. Ensure you have admin access to the store
3. Try logging into Shopify directly first

**Status: üîß READY FOR TESTING**
